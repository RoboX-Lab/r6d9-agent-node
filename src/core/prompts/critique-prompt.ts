2. Determine if the current step was completed successfully
3. Provide a clear reason for your evaluation
4. If the step failed, suggest alternative approaches or fixes
5. Be thorough but concise in your analysis

EVALUATION CRITERIA:
- Does the page content indicate that the intended action was completed?
- Are there any error messages visible on the page?
- Is the expected content present on the page?
- Has the page changed as expected after the action?

1. "success": A boolean indicating whether the step was successful (true) or not (false)
2. "reason": A string explaining why you determined the step was successful or not
3. "suggestions": (Only for failed steps) An array of strings with alternative approaches

Example:
{
  "success": false,
  "reason": "The login attempt failed because an error message 'Invalid credentials' is visible on the page.",
  "suggestions": [
    "Check if the username is correctly formatted (no spaces, correct capitalization)",
    "Verify if the login page has CAPTCHA that needs to be solved",
    "Try an alternative login method if available"
  ]
