# R6D9 Agent Node Architecture

This document provides a comprehensive overview of the R6D9 Agent Node architecture, explaining the core components, their interactions, and the design principles that guide the system.

## Overview

R6D9 Agent Node is a TypeScript framework for building and orchestrating AI agent workflows that interact with web browsers. It leverages language models and browser automation to create flexible, composable agents capable of complex task execution.

### Key Components

1. **Core Agents**
   - Specialized agents with focused capabilities
   - Modular design for composability
   - Standard interfaces for interoperability

2. **Orchestration Layer**
   - Workflow management with LangGraph
   - State management and transitions
   - Agent coordination and communication

3. **Browser Interface**
   - Playwright integration for browser automation
   - Page content extraction and processing
   - Action execution in browser context

4. **LLM Integration**
   - OpenAI API connection management
   - Prompt engineering and response handling
   - Error handling and retry logic

5. **Utilities & Support**
   - Logging and monitoring
   - Configuration management
   - Type definitions and shared interfaces

## Core Agents

### BrowserAgent

The BrowserAgent is responsible for browser automation and web interaction. It:

- Manages browser sessions with Playwright
- Executes navigation and interaction commands
- Extracts and processes page content
- Provides a high-level API for web automation

### PlannerAgent

The PlannerAgent generates step-by-step execution plans. It:

- Translates high-level objectives into concrete steps
- Refines plans based on feedback
- Provides structured planning output
- Adapts plans to changing conditions

### CritiqueAgent

The CritiqueAgent evaluates the success of executed steps. It:

- Analyzes page content against objectives
- Determines step success or failure
- Provides actionable feedback
- Suggests improvements for failed steps

## Workflow Orchestration

The system uses LangGraph for workflow orchestration:

1. **State Management**
   - Typed state objects with annotations
   - Clear state transitions
   - History tracking

2. **Execution Flow**
   - Plan -> Execute -> Critique -> Adapt cycle
   - Conditional branching based on critique results
   - Error handling and recovery

3. **Agent Coordination**
   - Sequential agent execution
   - State passing between agents
   - Result aggregation

## Data Flow

The typical data flow in a R6D9 Agent Node workflow:

1. User provides an objective
2. PlannerAgent generates a step-by-step plan
3. Orchestrator initializes the execution state
4. For each step:
   - BrowserAgent executes the step
   - CritiqueAgent evaluates the result
   - Orchestrator decides next action (continue, revise plan, etc.)
5. Final results are returned to the user

## Design Principles

### 1. Modularity

R6D9 Agent Node is designed with a strong emphasis on modularity:

- Each agent has a single, focused responsibility
- Agents can be used independently or composed
- New agents can be added without modifying existing ones

### 2. Type Safety

The system leverages TypeScript's type system:

- Comprehensive type definitions
- Interface-based design
- Runtime type checking where necessary
- Annotated state objects

### 3. Extensibility

The framework is designed to be easily extended:

- Plugin-like architecture for tools
- Configurable agent behaviors
- Customizable workflow definitions
- Flexible integration points

### 4. Robustness

The system prioritizes reliability:

- Comprehensive error handling
- Retry logic for external services
- Graceful degradation
- Detailed logging

## Implementation Details

### Agent Configuration

Agents accept a common configuration interface:

```typescript
type TAgentConfig = {
  modelName?: string;
  temperature?: number;
  maxTokens?: number;
  maxRetries?: number;
};
```

### Standard Agent Interface

All agents implement a consistent interface:

```typescript
interface IAgent<TInput, TOutput> {
  invoke(input: TInput): Promise<TOutput>;
  run(input: TInput): Promise<TOutput>;
}
```

### Workflow State

The orchestrator manages a comprehensive state object:

```typescript
const PlanExecuteState = Annotation.Root({
  objective: Annotation<string>(),
  currentUrl: Annotation<string>(),
  pageContent: Annotation<string>(),
  currentStep: Annotation<number>(),
  history: Annotation<string[]>(),
  response: Annotation<string>(),
  steps: Annotation<string[]>(),
  success: Annotation<boolean>(),
});
```

## Integration Patterns

### Browser Integration

The BrowserAgent uses Playwright to control browsers:

- Cross-browser compatibility (Chromium, Firefox, WebKit)
- Headless or headed mode
- Configurable timeouts and behavior
- Screenshot and DOM capture capabilities

### LLM Integration

The framework integrates with language models through LangChain:

- Flexible model selection (GPT-4, etc.)
- Structured prompt templates
- Output parsing and validation
- Token usage optimization

## Performance Considerations

The system addresses several performance aspects:

1. **Parallelization**
   - Concurrent execution where possible
   - Asynchronous operations

2. **Resource Management**
   - Browser instance pooling
   - Connection pooling for LLM requests
   - Memory optimization

3. **Caching**
   - LLM response caching
   - Page content caching
   - Plan step caching

## Security Considerations

The framework implements several security features:

1. **Isolation**
   - Browser sandboxing
   - Separate process execution

2. **Authentication**
   - API key management
   - Secure credential handling

3. **Data Handling**
   - Minimized data transfer
   - Optional content filtering

## Future Architecture Directions

Planned architectural improvements:

1. **Agent Memory**
   - Long-term knowledge storage
   - Session persistence
   - Cross-session learning

2. **Multi-Agent Collaboration**
   - Parallel agent execution
   - Specialized agent teams
   - Agent communication protocols

3. **Enhanced Reasoning**
   - Improved planning algorithms
   - Self-debugging capabilities
   - Goal decomposition strategies

4. **Ecosystem Integration**
   - API gateway capabilities
   - Service discovery
   - Event-driven architecture

## Conclusion

The R6D9 Agent Node architecture provides a flexible, extensible foundation for building AI agent systems that can interact with web interfaces. Its modular design, strong typing, and orchestration capabilities enable complex workflows while maintaining code quality and developer experience.
